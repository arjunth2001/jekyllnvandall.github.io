                    What is a comic without good Illustrations?&nbsp;Each
                    Illustration was hand made and the illustrations saw
                    increase in quality as the episodes progressed to match high
                    levels of standards seen in real comics. The illustrations
                    took a lot of effort and time and were designed with
                    intricate details.&nbsp; They account for more than 100
                    hours of extreme work. The illustrations were made in Adobe
                    Illustrator, Photoshop and Procreate on iPad. Later they
                    were put together with awesome dialogues in Adobe InDesign.
                    The Illustrations were inspired by our favourite comics and
                    we tried to meet their professional standards. We hope you
                    see the work that went into them.&nbsp;

                    A comic will be incomplete without sassy dialogues, a good
                    story and many twists... So we went ahead and overdid
                    ourselves in these areas...&nbsp;&nbsp;The story has a lot
                    of scope and has proper detailing and reasoning as to why an
                    algorithm is chosen and how it was solved in the situation.
                    There were a lot of unpredictable twists, especially in
                    episode 4, which we are sure, that it would make an impact
                    and strike a chord with the audience if one goes through all
                    the four episodes completely in sequence. We did a lot of
                    research on what makes stories from Movies and Comics that
                    we love so interesting and integrated these concepts into
                    the comic. Hope you enjoy the amount of detail and work that
                    went to this.

                    &nbsp;It was fascinating to realise that the algorithms
                    which we have been taught and researched and learnt about
                    have such varied applications in our real life. Though this
                    comic mostly deals with larger than life plots, the way we
                    could map a famous algorithm like Knapsack to a puzzle which
                    the protagonist has to solve for saving mankind, clearly
                    shows how algorithms have become an integral part of our
                    lives. It was a lot of fun to know about and realise the
                    necessity of algorithms in general, and specifically about
                    the wide applications they might have when it comes to
                    fiction.It helped us explore new concepts and new
                    algorithms. We have touched many new domains of algorithms.
                    We appreciated the way the algorithms were proved. It really
                    fascinated us. The way the approximation algorithms
                    providing guarantees has provided a new way for us to link
                    our mathematical and algorithmic experience. The NP complete
                    problems exposed us to the fact that how hard it can be to
                    solve a problem.&nbsp;

          concepts and new algorithms. We have touched many new domains of

          Kannan Sir and TAs for providing us with such a wonderful experience
          in this course, by giving us full freedom to explore and diverting
          away from the traditional methods of teaching. This was a new and
          better experience for all of us.
